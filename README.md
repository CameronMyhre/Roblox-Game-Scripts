# Roblox-Game-Scripts

**Purpose:** Read-only snapshot of the full Backrooms Unlimited codebase (Level 3 Revamp + shared framework) provided solely for MIT’s Maker Portfolio review.

**Scope & Structure:** The repository mirrors Roblox Studio’s project hierarchy; folders map to Roblox services (e.g., StarterPlayerScripts, ServerStorage) and include all scripts used by the framework and Level 3 content.
